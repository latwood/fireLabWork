The idea of this folder is to contain a large number of WindNinja config files, each just slightly changed for different types of simulations. It turns out that there are so many different combinations that can be run in WindNinja, and there are likely to be an increase in the number of inputs, that it was only plausible to create config files that I needed. Even though these config files may not be relevant in the future, it is useful to run all windninja simulations with a config file because that saves the meta data for the simulation! You know what input was used.

I'm hoping that someday they set up something that shows the output metadata in the form of a config file when using the gui. Something I haven't been adding, but that would be useful would be the windninja version/branch. I guess the branch and the date would be the most useful, or the date of the last update to the branch. Hm, that information is still pretty vague since you can have a branch that isn't updated compared to what is online. It becomes separate from the main solver. But I think it is close enough.
