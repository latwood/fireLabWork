     * This class is for generating outputting the cmd file that uses all the timestamps

     * since the timestamps and generatedVideoTimes should be the same size.
     *
     * Hopefully this class unclutters the main function and makes stuff easier to read.
     *
     * Should put the error handling to make sure the stuff coming in is the right size,
     * basically a last minute check to make sure the filler functions worked correctly.
