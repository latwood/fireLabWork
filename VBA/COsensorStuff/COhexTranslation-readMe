The VBA script in the excel file was useful for taking the RX/TX data generated by the sensor, and converting it into useful numbers. Just open the RX/TX debugger output, then open the service gui and you will see these numbers being populated. Ironically I found a way to directly output the information I wanted from all this just by selecting a checkbox, so all this work was for nothing, but it could be useful for understanding vba and for helping understand other hex translations, so I kept the script.
