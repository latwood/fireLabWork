Okay, so I calculated the cell center positions and made a list of them. I then opened paraFoam, made it viewable by T as surfaceWithEdges and added that legend. I placed the legend at the bottom.
Then I did cell centers of the whole thing. Then I did y normal slices for each cell center. Finally I did glyphs with transform scales of 0.2 for each dimension, and made the cell centers visible by U, using that as the scale for that.
Then I went through, only having each 12 slices and glyphs turned on, and made 1500x1500 pictures for that time.
At each subsequent time, need to rescale the scales, but make sure to do it while highlighting the openfoam case and the cell centers, not the glyphs or slices
I almost forgot. I did a south view at elevation 45, shifting scales or the domain up till everything looked nice

Scale for U shouldn't change unless U is updated. Vectors shouldn't change either, which would mean that there aren't quite enough points
