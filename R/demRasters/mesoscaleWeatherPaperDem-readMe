It took forever to get a case where we could run the energy equation solvers without the case diverging. But after we finally got a stable case, it was non-physical. While the wind flow patterns looked like they could be realistic, wind speeds and all variables seemed very large in magnitude compared to what we expected. In addition, we knew the results were non-physical because the temperature of the ground would spread to fill the entire atmosphere with the temperature of the ground within 5 minutes or so, which is not realistic.

Eventually, we decided that maybe it was the way the wall function spread heat from the ground into the atmosphere and tried to set up a case that could have high enough mesh resolution to obtain a realistic y+ value (100 to 300 instead of over 10,000). At the same time, Natalie realized that while we knew the values couldn't be realistic, we didn't really have a way to compare them to real values just using the idealized v-shaped valleys. So we decided to make a new base case which would be for replicating the cases shown in two papers by Schmidli et al. The idea was to replicate the exact case as much as possible, and see what we needed to change to get close to their results.

In the end, I was able to recreate the dems used in both papers using the two mesoscaleWeatherPaperDem scripts. Paper1 refers to Schmidli2011, or the "Intercomparison of Mesoscale Model Simulations of the Daytime Valley Wind System" written by Schmidli et all May 2011. Paper2 refers to Schmidli2010, or the "Mechanisms of Along-Valley Winds and Heat Exchange over Mountainous Terrain" by Schmidli et al written April 2010.
