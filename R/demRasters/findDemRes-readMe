As I did work and left cases behind, I periodically needed to revisit them. I found that without having saved cfg files, I knew most of the inputs, but not quite enough. Also, I noticed that there were discrepancies between the gui and cli mesh resolutions for input vs output stuff unless you set the resolutions. In addition, I needed to know the stl resolution and tif resolution to do the mesh conversion correctly.

This script is very simple, but the idea was to keep an easy to understand and use script for outputting the mesh resolution.
