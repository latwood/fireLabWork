When I did the meshCount and meshIteration projects, I needed a script that could make comparison pictures between all the different rasters. I made a ton of different variations of this code before I got my final working stuff. These are my collection of scripts used to do the job, where I wasn't smart enough to make a separately named copy for the two different projects.

Actually, I may have created separate copies. I need to go through and figure out what is going on because I found similar scripts in the R/WindNinja folder.
