When I was doing the meshCount and meshIteration project, I needed to plot the residuals. I found that to be rather tough, but realized that I could just write a data parser for the log produced by the solver when using CPL_DEBUG=NINJAFOAM. This worked at the time, but what I didn't realize was that the output WILL change for every different type and style of solver. So my script probably won't work except for that one application. In fact, I only plotted the final residuals for a given solver case, which may not have been the residual plots that we actually wanted. This means that at some time, I need to redo this script and work. At least it has a lot of useful tricks that may not be the most efficient or useful, but are a starting point for doing data parsing.

In fact, I found that OpenFOAM already has a nice data parser called foamLog. Then you can use xmgrace to plot all the residuals and other information. I don't know if it still works if you break up the simulation into multiple logs, but it probably works a lot better and more efficiently than this script. I just want to make sure I still have the script so that I have my own personal starting point for doing something similar in this or another language.
