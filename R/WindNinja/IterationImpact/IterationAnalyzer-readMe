I noticed that I also have more of this same script in Rstuff. I think that some of these could be just the older versions of the same script, where I didn't want to lose some of the ideas that I used when coding.

This script was written for the IterationImpact project, where the idea was to run the momentum solver in WindNinja at differing numbers of iterations, and compare the results with a run with a huge number of iterations (the converged solution). If results were close enough with fewer iterations for a bunch of different cases, then the default iteration count in WindNinja could be lowered, speeding up run times considerably.

So the idea was to plot residuals, plot the rasters of the wind velocities and wind directions, and plot differences in these quantities (which were the most useful pictures).
